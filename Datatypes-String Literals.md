# EX 1 (E) Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## Program
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## Output
<img width="934" height="211" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bae3dd60-13b5-4bcc-b656-55aabae422f3" />

## Result
 Thus, the Python program to read a string from the user is executed and printed successfully.
